# Elastic Search Guide

This are my notes on **ElasticSearch** and **search methods** with focus on Machine Learning.

I created most of the content in this `README.md` after following the course [Complete Guide to Elasticsearch (Udemy), by Bo Andersen](https://www.udemy.com/course/elasticsearch-complete-guide). That course has a Github repository: [codingexplained/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch](https://github.com/codingexplained/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch).

The respository is structured as follows:

- ...
- [`ml_search/`](./ml_search/)
