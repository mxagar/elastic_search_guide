# Elastic Search Guide

This are my notes on **ElasticSearch** and **search methods** with focus on Machine Learning.

I created most of the content in this `README.md` after following the course [Complete Guide to Elasticsearch (Udemy), by Bo Andersen](https://www.udemy.com/course/elasticsearch-complete-guide). That course has a Github repository: [codingexplained/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch](https://github.com/codingexplained/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch).

## Introduction

[Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/) is an open source analytics and full-text search engine.

We can add complex search functionalities to our applications (e.g., Wiki, e-commerce, etc.), similar to Google, with:

- autocompletion
- highlighting
- typo correction
- handling synonyms
- adjusting relevance
- etc.

We can also query structured data and we can use the platform as an analytics tool (with visualization).

Common example: APM (Application Performance Management) = store logs, be able to search in them, visualize in dashboard, etc.

We can apply ML techniques to get insights from data: forecasts, anomaly detection, etc.

In ES data is stored in **Documents**, represented as `JSON` objects:

- A Document is analog to a **row** in a relational DB.
- A Document contains **Fields**, analog to columns in a relational DB.

We perform queries via a REST API, also with `JSONs`.

Some other properties:

- ES is written in Java, on top of Apache Lucene.
- Easy to use, but has many features.
- Distributed.
- Highly scalable.
- Used by many large companies: FB, Netflix, etc.
- Queries can be done using Query DSL

### Elastic Stack

Elastic has built several products which can interact with each other:

- Elastic Search (ES): search.
- **Kibana**: analytics and visualization; dashboard for Elastic Search, ML. [Kibana Demo](https://demo.elastic.co/app/dashboards#/view/welcome_dashboard).
- Logstash: processing of logs and any data; events from different sources (there are many input/output plugins) are processed (e.g., clean, structure, etc.) and sent to Elastic Search or other destinations.
- X-Pack: additional features for ES and Kibana, such as 
  - security and access management, 
  - monitoring of resources (CPU, memory, etc.), 
  - **machine learning** (anomaly detection, forecasting, etc.)
  - graph structures
  - SQL capabilities, besides Query DSL
- Beats - Filebeats, Metricbeats, etc.: lightweight agents which collect and send data to ES. Filebeats collects logs. They are for data ingestion.

### Common Application Architecture

Let's consider an e-commerce site, where users can buy things via a web store/page. We have these components:

- The web frontend.
- The application backend.
- A relational DB where all the products are stored.

If we want to add realtime search capabilities to the web page so that users can find things easily, we need to add **Elastic Search**.

The best approach is to **replicate** all the data entries in the DB into ES; we can do that 

- initially with a script
- and then, we let the backend update ES when the DB is updated, too.

Then, we might connect **Kibana** to ES in order to visualize data in a dashboard: number of orders per week, revenue, etc.

![Architecture: Basic](./assets/architecture_2.png)

As our web grows, we might have increeased traffic and the servers might be suffering; that's when we add **Metricbeat**, which monitors performance and resources on the backend machine and sends them to ES. Basically, ES opens an ingest node where Metricbeat sends data. We can visualize all that in Kibana, too.

Similarly, we can monitor access and error logs. We do that with **Filebeat**, similar to Metricbeat.

As the web grows we might need some data processing before ingestion to ES. One option would be to implement that processing in the backend, but it has several drawbacks: 

- the backend should run the web, not loose resources processing logs, 
- if we have a decentrilized architecture (i.e., microservices), the logging is also decentralized, and we might want to have a centralized and homogeneous processing.

Thus, it makes sense to add **Logstash** to the architecture, which enables log/data processing before ingestion to ES. Although the data from Metricbeat often times doesn't need to be processed, the data from Filebeat could need to be processed, so it is first sent to Logstash, which transforms it and sends it to ES. However, we always have the felxibility to send the data to ES first, without any processing.

<!--
Our database and ES should be synchronized. However, ideally, our application should have read permissions in ES. How is that possible?
