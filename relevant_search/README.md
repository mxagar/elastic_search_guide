## Chapter 1: The Search Relevance Problem

- Search is everywhere, seamlessly integrated.
- **Relevance**: ranking content for a search based on how much that content satisfies, among others, the *needs of the user*. Depending on the application, relevance varies:
  - Web search: trustworthiness is important, i.e., Google's PageRank.
  - E-Commerce: affordable products are important, but also profit for Amazon, i.e., properly using stock.
  - Expert search: doctors might use jargon and perform a practical search to know about how to help their patients or search to do research on illnesses.
  - Etc.
- Therefore, relevance is not related only to satisfying the *user needs*, it is also associated with:
  - Satisfying business needs (e.g., Amazon wants to sell and make profit, Google wants to show adds, etc.)
  - User experience / background / motivation, or application context (e.g., doctors looking for information for patients or research)
- **Information Retrieval (IR)**: academic discipline behind search relevance.
  - Relevance: related to most satisfying information for user.
  - IR: focused on ranking.
- Key elements of a search and relevance:
  - **Features**: properties of the items being searched, e.g., descriptive characteristics like T-Shirt and size. 
  - **Signals**: cues used to modify the ranking during search-time; they affect the ranking function, e.g., user ratings.
- Information curation from domain experts and user feedback are fundamental to improve search.
